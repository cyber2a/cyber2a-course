## Section 1: What is AI?

**Definition:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable of performing tasks requiring cognitive functions, such as recognizing patterns, learning from data, and making predictions.

**Key takeaway:** AI helps identify patterns in data, supporting every step of the scientific method, from observation to conclusion.


## Section 2: The Role of AI in Modern Research

- **Genomics Example:** AI helped detect complex genetic patterns in rice genotypes.
- **Astrophysics Example:** AI's role in analyzing cosmic data for solving the Missing Satellite Problem.
- **Arctic Research Example:** AI predicts ice movement patterns, supporting Arctic expeditions by analyzing satellite imagery.

Ask the audience for scientific discoveries they know of that wouldn’t have been possible without AI.

**Key takeaway:** AI accelerates discoveries across various fields, from genomics to climate modeling and astrophysics.

## Section 3: AI Types and Techniques

### Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning focuses on algorithms that allow computers to learn from data. Link ML to psychology through Geoffrey Hinton and the rise of deep learning (DL).

- **Supervised Learning:** Training on labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Discovering patterns within unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** An agent learns by interacting with an environment, commonly used in robotics.

### Neural Networks (NN)
- Inspired by the brain’s structure, NNs consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information.
  
### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- CNNs are specialized for processing structured data, like images.

**Key takeaway:** ML techniques are vital for Arctic research, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.


## Section 4: Working with Datasets 

### Importance of Data
"Garbage in, garbage out" is especially true in AI. Quality data leads to accurate models.

- **Structured Data:** Clearly defined types (e.g., temperature readings).
- **Unstructured Data:** Complex formats (e.g., satellite imagery), requiring preprocessing.

**Key takeaway:** Quality data is the foundation for accurate predictions and insights in AI.


## Section 5: Hands-On: Building a Simple ML Model 

Guide participants through building a simple model in Python.

**Key takeaway:** Machine Learning involves algorithms that allow systems to learn from data, making predictions.


## Section 6: Rapid Surge in AI Talk: Why Now?

Ask the audience: Why has AI been a hot topic recently? Discuss the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT-3, and the role of transformers.

### Brief History:
- In 2017, the **Transformer** architecture allowed models to weigh word importance, revolutionizing LLMs.

**Key takeaway:** The transformer model paved the way for advanced LLMs like GPT-3, driving the current AI surge.

## Section 7: The Future of AI in Science (7 minutes)

**Exercise:** Invite participants to imagine how AI could transform their Arctic research areas.

- **Scientific Method:**
  - **Observation:** AI aids data collection (e.g., computer vision).
  - **Hypothesis:** Unsupervised learning clusters data.
  - **Experiment:** Reinforcement learning simulates environments.
  - **Conclusion:** AI can analyze data and validate hypotheses.


## Section 8: Q&A and Recap (8 minutes)

Let's consider arctic-related challenges, recap the session, and link AI to the scientific method.
