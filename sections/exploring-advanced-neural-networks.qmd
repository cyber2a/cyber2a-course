# Exploring Advanced Neural Networks: Semantic Segmentation

## Overview

This session focuses on advanced neural networks, specifically targeting semantic segmentation. Participants will delve into models such as Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and U-Net, learning how these networks are structured, how they function, and how they can be applied to accurately segment and label each pixel of an image according to the object it represents. The goal is to deepen participants’ understanding of the technical foundations and practical applications of semantic segmentation, equipping them with the skills needed for hands-on implementation and exploration of its real-world utility, particularly in the context of Arctic research.

## Outline

* Introduction to semantic segmentation
* Overview of key models: Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and U-Net
* Detailed architecture and functionality
* Applications in Arctic research: case studies
* Conclusion and Q&A
