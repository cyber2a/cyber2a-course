## Goal {.unnumbered}
This hands-on lab session is designed to give participants practical experience in data annotation for deep learning. Participants will apply the methods, tools, and best practices discussed in the previous session, working directly with datasets to annotate data effectively.

## Key Elements {.unnumbered}
Use of annotation methods and tools, direct dataset interaction

## Hands-on annotation activitites (WIP!!)

Ideally we'll cover:
- Simple bounding box annotation
- Polygon annotation
- Interactive segmentation (like sam-geo)
- Using one or more locally installed tools
- and one or more cloud (web-based) tools

### Local tools
- [MakeSense](https://github.com/SkalskiP/make-sense)
  - See local setup with Docker
- [segment-geospatial](https://samgeo.gishub.org/) (samgeo) -- either locally or in Google colab?
  - My copy of the [Google Colab notebook](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q2_nxS8Wwk2m_ouubQ1XRyrtvBhJ5kuw) (related to [this workshop](https://samgeo.gishub.org/workshops/cn_workshop/))
- [cvat](https://www.cvat.ai/)
  - Locally with the [self-hosted application](https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat) if I can get the dang thing [installed & running](https://docs.cvat.ai/docs/administration/basics/installation/)!
  - Otherwise people could create accounts and use their [hosted platform](https://app.cvat.ai/auth/login)
  - The V7 [cvat guide](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/cvat-guide) might be helpful?
- [VGG Image Annotator (VIA)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/)
  - Try local installation?
- :fire: [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/guide/labeling)
  - Multi-type data labeling and annotation tool with standardized output format
  - Works on various data types (text, image, audio)
  - Has both [open source option](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio) and [paid cloud service](https://humansignal.com/goenterprise/)
  - See online [playground](https://labelstud.io/playground/)

### Web-based tools
- Choose some service with free tier, create accounts, and try out?
  Maybe folks choose from among some options, try out, then report back?
- Check out [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org)
- [SAM demo](https://segment-anything.com/demo#) for understanding how this can be used for interactive segmentation
