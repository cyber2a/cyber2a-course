              The Global Climate Observing System and Global Terrestrial Observing Network have identified permafrost as an ‘Essential Climate Variable,’ for which ground temperature and active layer dynamics are key variables. This work presents long-term climate, and permafrost monitoring data at seven sites representative of diverse climatic and environmental conditions in the western Russian Arctic. The region of interest is experiencing some of the highest rates of permafrost degradation globally. Since 1970, mean annual air temperatures and precipitation have increased at rates from 0.05 to 0.07 °C yr
              −1
              and 1 to 3 mm yr
              −1
              respectively. In response to changing climate, all seven sites examined show evidence of rapid permafrost degradation. Mean annual ground temperatures increases from 0.03 to 0.06 °C yr
              −1
              at 10–12 m depth were observed in continuous permafrost zone. The permafrost table at all sites has lowered, up to 8 m in the discontinuous permafrost zone. Three stages of permafrost degradation are characterized for the western Russian Arctic based on the observations reported.},

	abstract = {Permafrost temperatures have increased in polar and high-elevation regions, affecting the climate system and the integrity of natural and built environments. In this Review, we outline changes in the thermal state of permafrost, focusing on permafrost temperatures and active-layer thickness. Increases in permafrost temperature vary spatially owing to interactions between climate, vegetation, snow cover, organic-layer thickness and ground ice content. In warmer permafrost (temperatures close to 0 °C), rates of warming are typically less than 0.3 °C per decade, as observed in sub-Arctic regions. In colder permafrost (temperatures less than −2 °C), by contrast, warming of up to about 1 °C per decade is apparent, as in the high-latitude Arctic. Increased active-layer thicknesses have also been observed since the 1990s in some regions, including a change of 0.4 m in the Russian Arctic. Simulations unanimously indicate that warming and thawing of permafrost will continue in response to climate change and potentially accelerate, but there is substantial variation in the magnitude and timing of predicted changes between different models and scenarios. A greater understanding of longer-term interactions between permafrost, climate, vegetation and snow cover, as well as improved model representation of subsurface conditions including ground ice, will further reduce uncertainty regarding the thermal state of permafrost and its future response.},

Here we present 2750 end of summer thaw depths representing a range of vegetation characteristics in Interior Alaska measured over a 5 year period. This included the top and third wettest summers in the 91-year record and three summers with precipitation close to mean historical values. Increased rainfall led to deeper thaw across all sites with an increase of 0.7 ± 0.1 cm of thaw per cm of additional rain. Disturbed and wetland sites were the most vulnerable to rain-induced thaw with {\textasciitilde}1 cm of surface thaw per additional 1 cm of rain. Permafrost in tussock tundra, mixed forest, and conifer forest was less sensitive to rain-induced thaw. A simple energy budget model yields seasonal thaw values smaller than the linear regression of our measurements but provides a first-order estimate of the role of rain-driven sensible heat fluxes in high-latitude terrestrial permafrost. This study demonstrates substantial permafrost thaw from the projected increasing summer precipitation across most of the Arctic region.},

Rainfall extremes have been proposed to increase permafrost thaw, but the magnitude and duration of this effect are poorly understood. Here we present empirical evidence showing that one extremely wet summer (+100 mm; 120\% increase relative to average June–August rainfall) enhanced thaw depth by up to 35\% in a controlled irrigation experiment in an ice-rich Siberian tundra site. The effect persisted over two subsequent summers, demonstrating a carry-over effect of extremely wet summers. Using soil thermal hydrological modelling, we show that rainfall extremes delayed autumn freeze-up and rainfall-induced increases in thaw were most pronounced for warm summers with mid-summer precipitation rainfall extremes. Our results suggest that, with rainfall and temperature both increasing in the Arctic, permafrost will likely degrade and disappear faster than is currently anticipated based on rising air temperatures alone.},

	abstract = {Climate warming in regions of ice-rich permafrost can result in widespread thermokarst development, which reconfigures the landscape and damages infrastructure. We present multisite time series observations which couple ground temperature measurements with thermokarst development in a region of very cold permafrost. In the Canadian High Arctic between 2003 and 2016, a series of anomalously warm summers caused mean thawing indices to be 150–240\% above the 1979–2000 normal resulting in up to 90 cm of subsidence over the 12-year observation period. Our data illustrate that despite low mean annual ground temperatures, very cold permafrost ({\textless}−10 °C) with massive ground ice close to the surface is highly vulnerable to rapid permafrost degradation and thermokarst development. We suggest that this is due to little thermal buffering from soil organic layers and near-surface vegetation, and the presence of near-surface ground ice. Observed maximum thaw depths at our sites are already exceeding those projected to occur by 2090 under representative concentration pathway version 4.5.},

Because climate-model simulations of the sea-ice loss differ substantially, we used a robust linear relationship between monthly-mean September sea-ice area and cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to infer the future evolution of Arctic summer sea ice directly from the observational record. The observed linear relationship implies a sustained loss of 3 ± 0.3 square meters of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO2 emission. On the basis of this sensitivity, Arctic sea ice will be lost throughout September for an additional 1000 gigatons of CO2 emissions. Most models show a lower sensitivity, which is possibly linked to an underestimation of the modeled increase in incoming longwave radiation and of the modeled transient climate response.},

Field sampling investigated vegetation community composition in different habitat types. Our analysis shows that vegetation productivity changes are substantial on Banks Island, where productivity has increased across about 80\% of the study area. Rising productivity levels can be attributed to increasing biomass of the plant communities in both upland and lowland habitats. Our analysis also shows that the magnitude of greening is mediated by terrain characteristics related to soil moisture. Shifts in tundra vegetation will impact wildlife habitat quality, surface energy balance, permafrost dynamics, and the carbon cycle; additional research is needed to explore the effects of more productive vegetation communities on these processes in the high Arctic.},

These changes pose a risk to infrastructure, impacting the accessibility and development of remote locations and adding additional pressures on local and regional budgets. This study estimates the costs of fixed infrastructure affected by climate change impacts in the Arctic region, specifically on the impacts of permafrost thaw. Geotechnical models are forced by climate data from six CMIP5 models and used to evaluate changes in permafrost geotechnical characteristics between the decades of 2050–2059 and 2006–2015 under the RCP8.5 scenario. Country-specific infrastructure costs are used to estimate the value of infrastructure affected. The results show a 27\% increase in infrastructure lifecycle replacement costs across the circumpolar permafrost regions. In addition, more than 14\% of total fixed infrastructure assets are at risk of damages due to changes in specific environmental stressors, such as loss of permafrost bearing capacity and thaw subsidence due to ground ice melt. Regions of Northern Canada and Western Siberia are projected to be particularly affected and may require additional annual spending in the excess of 1\% of annual GRP to support existing infrastructure into the future.},

	abstract = {Climate change and associated Arctic amplification cause a degradation of permafrost which in turn has major implications for the environment. The potential turnover of frozen ground from a carbon sink to a carbon source, eroding coastlines, landslides, amplified surface deformation and endangerment of human infrastructure are some of the consequences connected with thawing permafrost. Satellite remote sensing is hereby a powerful tool to identify and monitor these features and processes on a spatially explicit, cheap, operational, long-term basis and up to circum-Arctic scale. By filtering after a selection of relevant keywords, a total of 325 articles from 30 international journals published during the last two decades were analyzed based on study location, spatio-temporal resolution of applied remote sensing data, platform, sensor combination and studied environmental focus for a comprehensive overview of past achievements, current efforts, together with future challenges and opportunities. The temporal development of publication frequency, utilized platforms/sensors and the addressed environmental topic is thereby highlighted. The total number of publications more than doubled since 2015. Distinct geographical study hot spots were revealed, while at the same time large portions of the continuous permafrost zone are still only sparsely covered by satellite remote sensing investigations. Moreover, studies related to Arctic greenhouse gas emissions in the context of permafrost degradation appear heavily underrepresented. New tools (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)), methodologies (e.g., deep learning or data fusion etc.) and satellite data (e.g., the Methane Remote Sensing LiDAR Mission (Merlin) and the Sentinel-fleet) will thereby enable future studies to further investigate the distribution of permafrost, its thermal state and its implications on the environment such as thermokarst features and greenhouse gas emission rates on increasingly larger spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Very high spatial resolution commercial satellite imagery can inform observation, mapping, and documentation of micro-topographic transitions across large tundra regions. The bridging of fine-scale field studies with pan-Arctic system assessments has until now been constrained by a lack of overlap in spatial resolution and geographical coverage. This likely introduced biases in climate impacts on, and feedback from the Arctic region to the global climate system. The central objective of this exploratory study is to develop an object-based image analysis workflow to automatically extract ice-wedge polygon troughs from very high spatial resolution commercial satellite imagery. We employed a systematic experiment to understand the degree of interoperability of knowledge-based workflows across distinct tundra vegetation units—sedge tundra and tussock tundra—focusing on the same semantic class. In our multi-scale trough modelling workflow, we coupled mathematical morphological filtering with a segmentation process to enhance the quality of image object candidates and classification accuracies. Employment of the master ruleset on sedge tundra reported classification accuracies of correctness of 0.99, completeness of 0.87, and F1 score of 0.92. When the master ruleset was applied to tussock tundra without any adaptations, classification accuracies remained promising while reporting correctness of 0.87, completeness of 0.77, and an F1 score of 0.81. Overall, results suggest that the object-based image analysis-based trough modelling workflow exhibits substantial interoperability across the terrain while producing promising classification accuracies. From an Arctic earth science perspective, the mapped troughs combined with the ArcticDEM can allow hydrological assessments of lateral connectivity of the rapidly changing Arctic tundra landscape, and repeated mapping can allow us to track fine-scale changes across large regions and that has potentially major implications on larger riverine systems.},

	abstract = {Rapid global warming is catalyzing widespread permafrost degradation in the Arctic, leading to destructive land-surface subsidence that destabilizes and deforms the ground. Consequently, human-built infrastructure constructed upon permafrost is currently at major risk of structural failure. Risk assessment frameworks that attempt to study this issue assume that precise information on the location and extent of infrastructure is known. However, complete, high-quality, uniform geospatial datasets of built infrastructure that are readily available for such scientific studies are lacking. While imagery-enabled mapping can fill this knowledge gap, the small size of individual structures and vast geographical extent of the Arctic necessitate large volumes of very high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery. Transforming this ‘big’ imagery data into ‘science-ready’ information demands highly automated image analysis pipelines driven by advanced computer vision algorithms. Despite this, previous fine resolution studies have been limited to manual digitization of features on locally confined scales. Therefore, this exploratory study serves as the first investigation into fully automated analysis of sub-meter spatial resolution satellite imagery for automated detection of Arctic built infrastructure. We tasked the U-Net, a deep learning-based semantic segmentation model, with classifying different infrastructure types (residential, commercial, public, and industrial buildings, as well as roads) from commercial satellite imagery of Utqiagvik and Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. We also conducted a systematic experiment to understand how image augmentation can impact model performance when labeled training data is limited. When optimal augmentation methods were applied, the U-Net achieved an average F1 score of 0.83. Overall, our experimental findings show that the U-Net-based workflow is a promising method for automated Arctic built infrastructure detection that, combined with existing optimized workflows, such as MAPLE, could be expanded to map a multitude of infrastructure types spanning the pan-Arctic.},

	abstract = {Data are available for download at http://arcticdata.io/data/10.18739/A2KW57K57 Permafrost can be indirectly detected via remote sensing techniques through the presence of ice-wedge polygons, which are a ubiquitous ground surface feature in tundra regions. Ice-wedge polygons form through repeated annual cracking of the ground during cold winter days. In spring, the cracks fill in with snowmelt water, creating ice wedges, which are connected across the landscape in an underground network and that can grow to several meters depth and width. The growing ice wedges push the soil upwards, forming ridges that bound low-centered ice-wedge polygons. If the top of the ice wedge melts, the ground subsides and the ridges become troughs and the ice-wedge polygons become high-centered. Here, a Convolutional Neural Network is used to map the boundaries of individual ice-wedge polygons based on high-resolution commercial satellite imagery obtained from the Polar Geospatial Center. This satellite imagery used for the detection of ice-wedge polygons represent years between 2001 and 2021, so this dataset represents ice-wedge polygons mapped from different years. This dataset does not include a time series (i.e. same area mapped more than once). The shapefiles are masked, reprojected, and processed into GeoPackages with calculated attributes for each ice-wedge polygon such as circumference and width. The GeoPackages are then rasterized with new calculated attributes for ice-wedge polygon coverage such a coverage density. This release represents the region classified as “high ice” by Brown et al. 1997. The dataset is available to explore on the Permafrost Discovery Gateway (PDG), an online platform that aims to make big geospatial permafrost data accessible to enable knowledge-generation by researchers and the public. The PDG project creates various pan-Arctic data products down to the sub-meter and monthly resolution. Access the PDG Imagery Viewer here: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/portals/permafrost Data limitations in use: This data is part of an initial release of the pan-Arctic data product for ice-wedge polygons, and it is expected that there are constraints on its accuracy and completeness. Users are encouraged to provide feedback regarding how they use this data and issues they encounter during post-processing.

While individual rights can be useful, in privacy law they have historically unreasonably burdened the average data subject. “Meaningful information” about algorithmic logics is more technically possible than commonly thought, but this exacerbates a new “transparency fallacy” — an illusion of remedy rather than anything substantively helpful. While rights-based approaches deserve a firm place in the toolbox, other forms of governance, such as impact assessments, “soft law”, judicial review and model repositories deserve more attention, alongside catalysing agencies acting for users to control algorithmic system design.},

	url = {https://zenodo.org/records/3240529},
	abstract = {A remarkable time of human promise has been ushered in by the convergence of the ever-expanding availability of big data, the soaring speed and stretch of cloud computing platforms, and the advancement of increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms.


Innovations in AI are already leaving a mark on government, by improving the provision of essential social goods and services from healthcare, education, and transportation to food supply, energy, and environmental management. These bounties are likely just the start. 


The prospect that progress in AI will help government to confront some of its most urgent challenges is exciting, but legitimate worries abound. As with any new and rapidly evolving technology, a steep learning curve means that mistakes and miscalculations will be made and that both unanticipated and harmful impacts will occur. 


In order to manage these impacts responsibly and to direct the development of AI systems toward optimal public benefit, The Alan Turing Institute's public policy programme partnered with the Office for Artificial Intelligence and the Government Digital Service to produce guidance on the responsible design and implementation of AI systems in the public sector. 


The guide, Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety, is the most comprehensive guidance on the topic of AI ethics and safety in the public sector to date. It identifies the potential harms caused by AI systems and proposes concrete, operationalisable measures to counteract them. The guide stresses that public sector organisations can anticipate and prevent these potential harms by stewarding a culture of responsible innovation and by putting in place governance processes that support the design and implementation of ethical, fair, and safe AI systems.


The guidance is relevant to everyone involved in the design, production, and deployment of a public sector AI project: from data scientists and data engineers to domain experts, delivery managers and departmental leads. Our aim -- and hope -- in writing the guide is to encourage civil servants interested in conducting AI projects to make considerations of AI ethics and safety a first priority.},

ML approaches—one of the typologies of algorithms underpinning artificial intelligence—are typically developed as black boxes. The implication is that ML code scripts are rarely scrutinised; interpretability is usually sacrificed in favour of usability and effectiveness. Room for improvement in practices associated with programme development have also been flagged along other dimensions, including inter alia fairness, accuracy, accountability, and transparency. In this contribution, the production of guidelines and dedicated documents around these themes is discussed. The following applications of AI-driven decision-making are outlined: (a) risk assessment in the criminal justice system, and (b) autonomous vehicles, highlighting points of friction across ethical principles. Possible ways forward towards the implementation of governance on AI are finally examined.},

In fact, much can be learned from other domains where AI was introduced, often with the best of intentions, yet often led to unintended societal consequences, such as hard coding racial bias in the criminal justice system or increasing economic inequality through the financial system. A common misconception is that the environmental sciences are immune to such unintended consequences when AI is being used, as most data come from observations, and AI algorithms are based on mathematical formulas, which are often seen as objective. In this article, we argue the opposite can be the case. Using specific examples, we demonstrate many ways in which the use of AI can introduce similar consequences in the environmental sciences. This article will stimulate discussion and research efforts in this direction. As a community, we should avoid repeating any foreseeable mistakes made in other domains through the introduction of AI.

Privacy breaches in the collection, use, and sharing of big data have affected all the major tech players, be it Facebook, Google, Apple, or Uber, and go beyond the corporate world including governments, municipalities, and educational and health institutions. What has come to light is that enabled by the rapid growth of social media and mobile apps, various stakeholders collect and use large amounts of data, disregarding the ethics and politics. As big data touch on many realms of daily life and have profound impacts in the social world, the scrutiny around big data practice becomes increasingly relevant. This special issue investigates the ethics and politics of big data using a wide range of theoretical and methodological approaches. Together, the articles provide new understandings of the many dimensions of big data ethics and politics, showing it is important to understand and increase awareness of the biases and limitations inherent in big data analysis and practices.},

	abstract = {This article conceptualises and provides an initial roadmap for operationalising a feminist data ethics of care framework for the subfield of artificial intelligence (‘AI’) known as ‘machine learning’. After outlining the principles and praxis that comprise our framework, and then using it to evaluate the current state of mainstream AI ethics content, we argue that this literature tends to be overly abstract and founded on a heteropatriarchal world view. We contend that because most AI ethics content fails to equitably and explicitly assign responsibility to actors in the machine learning economy, there is a risk of implicitly reinforcing the status quo of gender power relations and other substantive inequalities, which contribute to the significant gap between AI ethics principles and applied AI ethics more broadly. We argue that our feminist data ethics of care framework can help to fill this gap by paying particular attention to both the ‘who’ and the ‘how’, as well as by outlining a range of methods, approaches, and best practices that societal actors can use now to make interventions into the machine learning economy. Critically, feminist data ethics of care is unlikely to be achieved in this context unless all stakeholders, including women, men, and non-binary and transgender people, take responsibility for this much needed work.},

	abstract = {Understanding Earth system dynamics in light of ongoing human intervention and dependency remains a major scientific challenge. The unprecedented availability of data streams describing different facets of the Earth now offers fundamentally new avenues to address this quest. However, several practical hurdles, especially the lack of data interoperability, limit the joint potential of these data streams. Today, many initiatives within and beyond the Earth system sciences are exploring new approaches to overcome these hurdles and meet the growing interdisciplinary need for data-intensive research; using data cubes is one promising avenue. Here, we introduce the concept of Earth system data cubes and how to operate on them in a formal way. The idea is that treating multiple data dimensions, such as spatial, temporal, variable, frequency, and other grids alike, allows effective application of user-defined functions to co-interpret Earth observations and/or model–data integration. An implementation of this concept combines analysis-ready data cubes with a suitable analytic interface. In three case studies, we demonstrate how the concept and its implementation facilitate the execution of complex workflows for research across multiple variables, and spatial and temporal scales: (1) summary statistics for ecosystem and climate dynamics; (2) intrinsic dimensionality analysis on multiple timescales; and (3) model–data integration. We discuss the emerging perspectives for investigating global interacting and coupled phenomena in observed or simulated data. In particular, we see many emerging perspectives of this approach for interpreting large-scale model ensembles. The latest developments in machine learning, causal inference, and model–data integration can be seamlessly implemented in the proposed framework, supporting rapid progress in data-intensive research across disciplinary boundaries.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.adbb2d47},
	abstract = {ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 8 decades.
Data is available from 1940 onwards.
ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis.
Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.
ERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities.
An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble
at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience.
Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which
has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas.
To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too,
though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.
ERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days. In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. In case that this occurs users are notified.
The data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution.
It is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access.
It should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.
An overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in this article.
Information on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these guidelines.
Data has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for
the uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves).
There are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).

The dataset covers an area of 1.6 million square-kilometers (km²), with at least one coverage between 2021 and 2023, and provides annual coverage for approximately 900,000 km². In several highly active key sites, such as Banks Island, Peel Plateau, and Novaya Zemlya, we extended the data frequency and temporal coverage to 2018-2023. We mapped a total of more than 43,000 individual RTS and ALD, many of them multiple times. We offer two levels of datasets; Level 1: RTS footprints per image with timestamps; and Level 2: annually aggregated RTS footprints. Essential metadata includes image footprints, dataset coverage, timestamps, and model-specific information. To enhance reproducibility and further use, the training labels, processing code, and model checkpoints are publicly available. This version, v1, is the first openly accessible release. The dataset will be maintained and continuously updated in both spatial and temporal extent. It can be used for mapping and quantifying RTS, analyzing spatio-temporal patterns of RTS dynamics, or serving as input for landscape dynamics models.},

These data can help researchers estimate population growth rates, age-class distribution and population demographics. Knowing population demographics, growth rates and trends is particularly valuable to fisheries managers who must perform population assessments to inform management decisions. These data are therefore particularly important in valuable fisheries like the salmon fisheries of Alaska. This dataset includes age, sex and length data compiled from annual sampling of commercial and subsistence salmon harvests and research projects in the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim region of Alaska. It includes data on five salmon species: chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye. There is some data on non-salmon species (whitefish, sheefish, longnose sucker, Dolly Varden) in the Yukon dataset. There is an additional data table for more specific information about the locations where samples were collected. Age estimates were made by examining scales or bony structures (e.g. otoliths - ear bones). Scales were removed from the side of the fish; usually the left side above the lateral line. Scales or bony structures were then mounted on gummed cards and pressed on acetate to make an impression. The number of freshwater and saltwater annuli (i.e. rings) was counted to estimate age in years. Fish sex was determined by either examining external morphology (eg. head and belly shape) or internal sex organ. Length was measured in millimeters, generally from mid-eye to the fork of the tail. This data package includes the original data files, reformatting scripts that reformat the original data files into a consistent format, and the reformatted datasets.},

The growing global adoption of the FAIR Principles by policymakers, funders, and organizations compels data professionals, projects, and repositories to demonstrate the level of FAIR-compliance (referred to as FAIRness) of their digital data, metadata, and infrastructures. Because the FAIR Principles offer general objectives rather than specific implementation instructions, discrepancies exist due to different interpretations, domain-specific requirements, and intended applications. These discrepancies hinder direct comparisons and integration of assessment outcomes. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, including a consolidated FAIR vocabulary. This framework establishes quality measures upfront in FAIRness assessment workflows to surpass the intricacies arising from the aforementioned dependencies. The established quality measures encapsulate the distinctive core concepts inherent in individual FAIR principles and can serve as common, fundamental pillars of holistic FAIRness assessment workflows. Building upon this fundamental set of the quality measures, we introduce a FAIRness quality maturity matrix (FAIR-QMM) as a structured, tiered, and progressive approach for evaluating and reporting the degree of FAIR-compliance. The FAIR-QMM can be used as a FAIRness assessment tool independently and/or as a translator between other FAIRness assessment tools or models.},

Thus, these results should not be viewed as conclusive about the data sets presented, but rather illustrate the types of quantitative comparisons that will be able to be made when the FAIR metrics at DataONE have been finalized.},
