    "text": "Course Overview\nAI for Arctic Research represents an introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques produced by the Cyber2A project, an innovative training program to empower the Arctic science community with advanced AI-driven data analytics and cyberinfrastructure (CI) skills to tackle the pressing challenges facing the Arctic and thus our planet. Today, Artificial Intelligence has become one of the most powerful tools to analyze Arctic big data and enable new ways of data-driven discovery. However, training on these emerging topics is often missing in current undergraduate and graduate curricula, particularly for active Arctic researchers. This project aims to fill this skills gap in order to foster the growth of an Arctic science workforce with strong data science skills through a series of complementary and mutually reinforcing training activities.\nThe week-long course is designed with a modular curriculum, where each module can be incorporated into learning activities across Universities and other organizations. The curriculum is free to be re-used, licensed under a CC-BY Attribution license and covers 5 main topical areas:\nThe sections presented here fit into a one-week workshop as follows, but the modules can be also used individually:",

    "section": "10.1 Introduction",
    "text": "10.1 Introduction\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) can be thought of as the development of computer systems that can perform tasks we usually think require human intelligence, such as image recognition, language translation, or autonomous movement. The rapid development and adoption of AI tools in the past years, particularly machine learning algorithms, has revolutionized how big datasets are analyzed, transforming decision-making in all sectors of society. However, frameworks to examine the ethical considerations of AI are just emerging, and careful consideration of how to best develop and apply AI systems is essential to the responsible use of these new, rapidly changing tools. In this section, we will give an overview of the FAST Principles put forward by the Alan Turing Institute in their guide for the responsible design and implementation of AI systems (Leslie, 2019).\n\n10.1.1 The FAST Principles\nFAST stands for Fairness, Accountability, Sustainability, and Transparency. The FAST principles aim to guide the ethical development of AI projects from their inception to deployment. The continuous involvement and commitment of software developers, domain experts, technical leads, project managers, rightsholders, and collaborators involved in the AI project is crucial to implement these principles successfully. The following is a brief overview of each of the FAST principles, we greatly encourage you to read through the Alan Turing Institute guide to learn more!\n\n\n\nLeslie, 2019\n\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Fairness\nBias can enter at any point of a research project, from data collection and preprocessing, to model design and implementation. This is because AI projects, as any other, are created by human beings who (even with the best of intentions) can introduce error, prejudice, or misjudgement into a system. Fairness refers to the active minimization of bias and commitment to not harm others through the outcomes of an AI system. The FAST principles (Leslie, 2019) suggest the following baseline for fairness:\n\nThe designers and users of AI systems ensure that the decisions and behaviours of their models do not generate discriminatory or inequitable impacts on affected individuals and communities. This entails that these designers and users ensure that the AI systems they are developing and deploying:\n\nAre trained and tested on properly representative, relevant, accurate, and generalisable datasets (Data Fairness)\nHave model architectures that do not include target variables, features, processes, or analytical structures (correlations, interactions, and inferences) which are unreasonable, morally objectionable, or unjustifiable (Design Fairness)\nDo not have discriminatory or inequitable impacts on the lives of the people they affect (Outcome Fairness)\nAre deployed by users sufficiently trained to implement them responsibly and without bias (Implementation Fairness)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-life Example : Insufficient Radar Network\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following figure (McGovern et al., 2022) shows coverage of the national Doppler weather network (green and yellow circles) over a demographic map of the Black population in the southeast US. This would be an example of an issue in data fairness, since radar coverage does not represent the population uniformly, leaving out areas with higher Black population. Problems with outcome fairness could ensue if this non-representative biases an AI model to under-predict weather impacts in such populations.\n\n\n\nMcGovern et al., 2022 by courtesy of Jack Sillin (CC BY 4.0).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.3 Accountability\nAccountability in AI projects stems from the shared view that isolated AI models used to automate decisions are not morally responsible in the same way as a decision-making human. As outputs from AI models are increasingly used to make decisions that affect the environment and human lives, there is a critical need for competent human authorities to offer explanations and justifications for the development process, outputs, and ensuing decisions made by AI systems. Such answerability assignments can be challenging, as AI implementations are often the product of big development teams where the responsibility to answer for a project’s outcome may not be delineated, creating an issue known as “the problem of many hands.” The FAST principles encourage the following accountability implementation:\nAccountability by Design: All AI systems must be designed to facilitate end-to-end answerability and auditability. This requires both responsible humans-in-the-loop across the entire design and implementation chain as well as activity monitoring protocols that enable end-to-end oversight and review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-life Example: AI for natural disasters response\n\n\n\n\n\nAccountability and the ability to audit AI methods can be crucial when model outputs support critical decision-making, such as in natural disasters. In 2021, a New York Times investigation (Fink, 2021) covered a private company’s premature release of outputs about neighborhoods most affected by potential earthquakes in Seattle. While the initial release erroneously did not show threats for non-residential areas, ensuing updated versions showed non-compatible predictions again. Although the company acknowledged that its AI models would not replace the first responder’s judgment, the lack of audibility and opacity in the model development hindered accountability for any party, ultimately eroding the public confidence in the tools and leading to a loss of public resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.4 Sustainability\nSustainability in the FAST principles includes continuous assessment of the social impacts of an AI system and technical sustainability of the AI model. In the first consideration, the FAST principles advocate for performing a Stakeholder Impact Assessment (SIA) at different stages to help build confidence in the project and uncover unexpected risks or biases, among other benefits. The Alan Turing Institute guide shares a prototype of an SIA (Leslie, 2019). The core of technical sustainability is creating safe, accurate, reliable, secure, and robust AI systems. To achieve these technical goals, teams must implement thorough testing, performance metrics, uncertainty quantification, and be aware of changes to the underlying distribution of data, among other essential practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-life Example: SpaceCows\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SpaceCows project (Shepherd, 2021; ABC Australia, 2024) in northern Australia is a collaboration between scientists, industry leaders, and local indigenous communities developing AI centered platforms to analyze GPS tracking data collected from feral cows alongside satellite imagery and weather data. Indigenous knowledge and traditional land owners have been at the center of the development, providing guidance and ultimately benefiting from the AI tools to protect their land and cultural sites.\n\n\n\nImportant indigenous cultural sites can be damaged by feral cattle. Image from CSIRO, SpaceCows: Using AI to tackle feral herds in the Top End.\n\n\nVideos with more information on SpaceCows:\nCSIRO rolls out world’s largest remote ‘space cows’ herd management system\nSpaceCows: Using AI to tackle feral herds in the Top End\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.5 Transparency\nUnder the FAST principles, transparency in AI projects refers to transparency about how an AI project was designed and implemented and the content and justification of the outcome produced by the AI model. To ensure process transparency, the project should show how the design and implementation included ethical, safety, and fairness considerations throughout the project. To clarify the content and explain the outcomes of an AI system, the project should offer plain language, non-technical explanations accessible to non-specialists that convey how and why a model performed the way it did. In this direction, it is essential to avoid a ‘mathematical glass box’ where the code and mathematics behind the algorithm are openly available, but there is a lack of rationale about how or why the model goes from input to output. Finally, the explanations about how the outcomes were produced should become the basis to justify the outcomes in terms of ethical permissibility, fairness, and trustworthiness. A careful consideration of the balance between the sustainability and transparency principles is necessary when dealing with protected or private data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-life Example: France’s Digital Republic Act\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concern for transparency in using personal data is an active space for debate. In 2018, the French government passed a law to protect citizens’ privacy, establishing the citizen’s “right to an explanation” regarding, among other things, how an algorithm contributed to decisions on their persona and which data was processed (Edwards and Veale, 2017; Lo Piano, 2020). Overall, this legislation aims to create a fairer and more transparent digital environment where everyone can enjoy equal opportunities.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Google DeepMind\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.6 Conclusion\nAs new AI developments and applications rapidly emerge and transform everyday life, we need to pause and ensure these technologies are fair, sustainable, and transparent. We must acknowledge human responsibility in designing and implementing AI systems to use these novel tools fairly and with accountability. Finally, we acknowledge that the information covered here is a lightning introduction to AI’s ethical considerations and implications. Whether you are a researcher interested in using AI for the first time or a seasoned ML practitioner, we urge you to dive into the necessary and ever-expanding AI ethics work to learn how to best incorporate these concepts into your work.",

    "text": "17.1 Overview\nFoundation models (FM) are deep learning models trained on massive raw unlabelled datasets usually through self-supervised learning. FMs enable today’s data scientists to use them as the base and fine-tune using domain specific data to obtain models that can handle a wide range of tasks [1, 6, 7]. In this talk, we provide an introduction to FMs, its history, evolution, and go through its key features and categories, and a few examples. We also briefly discuss how foundation models work. This talk will be a precursor to the hands-on session that follows on the same topic.\nImage source: 2021 paper on foundation models by Stanford researchers [1].\nIn this session, we take a closer look at what constitutes a foundation model, a few examples, and some basic principles around how it works.",

Their checklist is as follows:\nFor all models and algorithms, check that you include:\n\nA clear description of the mathematical setting, algorithm, and/or model\nAn analysis of the complexity (time, space, sample size) of any algorithm\nA link to a downloadable source code*, with specification of all dependencies, including external libraries\n\nFor any theoretical claim, check that you include:\n\nA statement of the result\nA clear explanation of each assumption\nA complete proof of the claim\n\nFor all figures and tables that include empirical results, check that you include:\n\nA complete description of the data collection process, including sample size\nA link to a downloadable version of the dataset or simulation environment\nAn explanation of any data that was excluded and a description of any preprocessing step\nAn explanation of how samples were allocated for training, validation, and testing\nThe range of hyperparameters considered, method to select the best hyperparameter configuration, and specification of each hyperparameter used to generate results\nThe exact number of evaluation runs\nA description of how experiments were run\nA clear definition of the specific measure of statistics used to report results\nClearly defined error bars\nA description of results with central tendency (e.g., mean) and variation (e.g., standard deviation)\nA description of the computing infrastructure used\n\n*With sensitive data or proprietary code, scientists may not wish to release all of its code and data. In this case, data can be anonymized and/or partial code can be released that won’t run but can be read and reproduced\nConsider the sensitivity of your data/code when publishing.\n\nSensitive data should be anonymized before publishing\nResearchers or organizations may only release partial code if their code is propietary\nBe sure that the partial code released is still entirely executable",

This allows other researchers to:\n\nValidate the model\nTrack code construction and see any author annotations\nExpand on published work\n\nDespite this, sharing code does not always mean that models are fully reproducible. Many machine learning models are trained on restricted datasets or require extensive computing power for training the model. Because of this, there are a few additional criteria that improve reproducibility including:\n\nData and metadata availability (must be included without question)\nTransparency of the code you’re using and dependencies needed to run the code\nEasily installable computational analysis tools and pipelines\nInstalled software should behave the same on every machine and should have the same runtime\n\n\n19.5.1 Trips and Tricks to Sharing Code\n\nAvoid using absolute file paths when reading in data (and in general the use of slashes, as these differ between operating systems)\n\n\n\n\nAvoid using an absolute path to read in your data as shown here\n\n\n\nClean your data within your code\nAvoid copy/pasting in a spreadsheet\nAlways keep an unedited version of your raw data\n\n\n\n\nThe Reproducibility Spectrum by Altuna Akalin in Towards Data Science",

It is easily usable with Colab and Papers with Code, but models must be trained on openly accessible data.\n\nPapers with Code is an open source hub for publications that include direct links to GitHub code, no account needed to access datasets.  ## Version Control \n\nVersion control is the process of keeping track of every individual change by each contributor that’s saved in a version control framework, or a special database. Keeping a history of these changes to track model performance relative to model parameters saves the time you’d spend retraining the model. The three components of version control in machine learning are:\n\nCode: We recommend writing and storing your model code in the same language as your implementation code to make it easier to maintain all code and dependencies\nData: Versioning should link the data to the appropriate metadata and note any changes in either\nModel: The model connects your code and data with your model parameters and analysis\n\nUsing a version control system ensures easier:\n\nCollaboration\nVersioning\n\nIf your model breaks, you’ll have a log of any changes that were made, allowing you or others to revert back to a stable version\n\nDependency tracking\n\nYou can test more than one model on different branches or repositories, tune the model parameters and hyperparameters, and monitor the accuracy of each implemented change\n\nModel updates\n\nVersion control allows for incrementally released versions while continuing the development of the next release",
